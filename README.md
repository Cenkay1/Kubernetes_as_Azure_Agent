#Kubernetes CI/CD Agents on Azure

###Overview
This repository provides a comprehensive setup for using Kubernetes agents on Azure to run CI/CD pipelines. It includes configurations for KEDA-based autoscaling, Dockerfile for building your application, and Kubernetes manifests for deploying the setup.

###Key Components

KEDA (Kubernetes Event-driven Autoscaling): Automatically scales the number of agents based on workload.
Dockerfile: Defines the build process for your application.
Kubernetes Manifests: Includes deployment configurations for running your CI/CD agents on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

###Getting Started
######Prerequisites
Azure account with AKS cluster
Docker installed
Kubernetes CLI (kubectl) installed
Azure CLI (az) installed
Setup
Clone the Repository

bash
Copy Code

`git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
`cd your-repo

Build Docker Image

Navigate to the directory containing your Dockerfile and build the image:

bash
Kodu kopyala
docker build -t your-image-name .
Deploy to AKS

Apply the Kubernetes manifests to your AKS cluster:

bash
Kodu kopyala
kubectl apply -f keda-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
Configure KEDA

Ensure KEDA is set up in your cluster for autoscaling. Refer to the KEDA documentation for detailed configuration.

Usage
The CI/CD agents will scale dynamically based on workload, thanks to KEDA.
Use the provided Kubernetes manifests to deploy and manage your agents.
